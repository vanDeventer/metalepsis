# mbaigo System: Modboss

## Purpose
This system offers as services specific digital input and outputs (discrete inputs and coils) as well as analog (16 bits) registers holding registers and input registers.

The system was named Modboss because the system has a Modbus client as unit asset and the server on the PLC was called a slave.

## Compiling
To compile the code, one needs to get the mbaigo module
```go get github.com/sdoque/mbaigo```
and initialize the *go.mod* file with ``` github.com/sdoque/systems/modboss``` before running *go mod tidy*.

The reason the *go.mod* file is not included in the repository is that when developing the aigo module, a replace statement needs to be included to point to the development code.

To run the code, one just needs to type in ```go run modbus.go thing.go``` within a terminal or at a command prompt.

It is **important** to start the program from within it own directory (and each system should have their own directory) because it looks for its configuration file there. If it does not find it there, it will generate one and shutdown to allow the configuration file to be updated.

The configuration and operation of the system can be verified using the system's web server using a standard web browser, whose address is provided by the system at startup.

To build the software for one's own machine,
```go build -o modboss_imac```, where the ending is used to clarify for which platform the code is for.


## Cross compiling/building
The following commands enable one to build for different platforms:

- Raspberry Pi 64: ```GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o modboss_rpi64 modboss.go thing.go```


One can find a complete list of platform by typing *â€Œgo tool dist list* at the command prompt

If one wants to secure copy it to a Raspberry pi,
`scp modboss_rpi64 jan@192.168.1.6:mbaigo/modboss/` where user is the *username* @ the *IP address* of the Raspberry Pi with a relative (to the user's home directory) target *mbaigo/modboss/* directory.
